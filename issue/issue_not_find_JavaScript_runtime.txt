#issue: Could not find a JavaScript runtime. 
#See https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs for
#a list of available runtimes.

#change:
#$ git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
#$ cd node
#$ ./configure
#$ make
#$ sudo make install

#After that, run "bundle install" as usual 
#(from folder with ruby&rails project). 
#And the problem was resolved. Ruby did not 
#have to reinstall.
